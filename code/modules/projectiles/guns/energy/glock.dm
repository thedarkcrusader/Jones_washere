	Its externals appear to be based into a modified \"Sky\" pistol frame with elements from the various energy weapons being crammed into its exterior. \
	If you can get past its crude appearence it appears to be a well made firearm; sporting an improved grip compared to the pistol it was based off \
	and flexibility in firemodes; sporting a plasma setting, a laser setting and an emergency ion setting! \
	On the bottom of the grip appears to have a covered access port, a scipt \"M\" letter etched over the cover."
